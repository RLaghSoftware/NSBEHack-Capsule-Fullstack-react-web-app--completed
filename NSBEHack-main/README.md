We built an application for journalists, historians, and entheusiasts alike. In the app, you can store files or messages anonymously under an alias name, and find them by searching for a specific entry.

This is useful, as it allows anyone to secretly share information around the world instantly, and allows no deletion (other than by database owner), so no government official can try to hide history. Let's say, for example, there is injustice in a country where news isn't often reported. An individual can take an image and secretly upload it, and then the information is now public eye for news organizations to report on.

Beyond this, sharing of information/secrets is made easier on a central application, and the world can be truly informed without the worry of alterior motives. This means more honest journalism, reporting, and more public knowledge.

Beyond just knowledge, anyone can post a picture of nature, or of the ocean. This means photography and art from around the world is also shared, along with the future ability to tag posts. Each image will have a link, so it can be shared easily and without worry, and the app can serve as a way for organizations to link to certain files as well.

This is fundamentally different from social media: no likes, dislikes, comments etc. This is just a great way to share knowledge.

How to run:

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install MySQL workbench, or any app that lets you run MySQL

On root user, setting the password to 'your_current_password', create the database on DB.txt by copy and pasting the SQL commands

Then, git clone the directory from github link to your laptop

Go to the spot for the app in your terminal

Then run "npm install"

Finally, run "npm start"

run Node server.js

The app should now be running on port 3000, and can be visited through a web browser.

It may take some time (usually about 10/15 seconds) for the connection to go through after running server.js on your terminal
